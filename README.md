# photogallery

I worked on this for about three hours the first time around, then an additional 1.5 hours revising it to TS.
On the first draft, I didn't spend too much time on styling, but I think I recreated the mockup sketch pretty effectively.
Since I was interested in building the server routes too, I started from a combined React / Express template I'm familiar with, and added dependencies and modded it as I saw fit. 
I think this was within the bounds of the prompt since the backend was proposed as optional.
Going forward it would be great to add more error checking (especially on the back end). It would be fun to actually create personalized image folders for 
individula users, and password protect them. Support for batch photo uploading would be nice, as well as UI niceties like loading animations. Also, some decisions
regarding when the search images are shown could be made. I.E. new photo uploaded should show all images again, or still retain search bar filter?

Should start with npm i, npm start
